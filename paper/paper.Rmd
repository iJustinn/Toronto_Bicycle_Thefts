# introduction
write an intro to convey the issue
the goal of the article :be careful of bikes

# When Are Bikes at the Greatest Risk? A Look at Seasonal and weekly Patterns
Explore temporal insights, such as trends by month, day of the week with visualizations that reveal when thefts are most likely to occur.

# What Makes a Bike a Target? Analyzing Theft by Bicycle Type and Value
Discuss any available data on bike types, brands, or values, showing if certain bikes are more vulnerable to theft than others.

# A Decade of Disappearing Bikes: Tracing Theft Trends Over Ten Years
- timeline

# Mapping the Danger Zones: High-Risk Locations Across Toronto
Use a map visualization to highlight theft hotspots across Toronto, pointing out neighborhoods or transit hubs with the highest incidence rates.

- map

# Discussion 
- Consolidation of all the info that we present, we first talk about...this is how all visualizations are connected together, in the future what can be done...

# Conclusion
- short reminder for the audience, tips to protect their bikes


General tips: 
 - This paper wants to tell the story about tips to protect bikes
 
 - after every visualizations talk a bit about the visualization itself, key points, make sure the story that we are talking about is proved by this visualization so each plot make sense (for example in 2016 there is a peak in May illustrated by the visualization, why? find relevant news and articels to explain it and cite), 用更descriptive的形式去explain 你的visualization plot with proves.
